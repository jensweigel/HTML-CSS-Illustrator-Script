Use Illustrator to export HTML and CSS in one JavaScript action.

This is a very early verison. So im not a programmer. I Hope some can help me with this idea. Many things are not implemented yet.

How it works
1. Download the jsx file
2. Open Illustrator
3. Prepare you file. Use Layaers for the Tags. Make one main Layer called body
4. Save your file (just for getting sure. Illustartor or my script arent very stable
5. Go do folder where the AI is saved and generate a subfilder fileadmin and inseide this a folder called css (sorry I use Typo3 fill be fixed in futur release)
6. Chose File > Script > Other Script ... and choose the saved tohtmlcss.jsx file
7. Chose your Doctype and Language (maybe this isent your favor, so chamge it send me wishes ;-)
8. In the folder of your saved Ai you will find a index.html and in the subfolder fileadmin/css style.css 

Functions
* Layername will be Tagname body -> <bod></body>
* tagname.something -> <tagname class="something"></tagname>
* tagname#something -> <tagname id="something"></tagname>
* Cobination of the both are also possible
* Layers can be ordered in sublayers
* Layer named img generate an empty img tag and content will be ignored 
* Path with the name background are used to generate CSS with background and width information
* Lines with border-[top|bottom|left|right] are used for CSS border attribut
* Every paragraph amd character style will be converted to CSS

ToDo
* naming own folder for css
* naming filename for index.html and style.css
* Optional creating these folders
* Export caracter format
* slice img layers automatical
* generate true css margin and padding
* generate buttons
* generate inputs
* Shadow/inner Shadow
* Hover/active
* Problems with illustrator effects
* export TextFrames with Inline Styles
* Better calculating the width
* CSS Attribut width without background
