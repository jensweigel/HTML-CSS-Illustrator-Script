Use Illustrator to export HTML and CSS in one JavaScript action.

This is a very early verison. So im not a programmer. I Hope some can help me with this idea. Many things are not implemented yet.

Functions
* Layername will be Tagname body -> <bod></body>
* tagname.something -> <tagname class="something"></tagname>
* tagname#something -> <tagname id="something"></tagname>
* Cobination of the both are also possible
* Layers can be ordered in sublayers
* Layer named img generate an empty img tag and content will be ignored 
* Path with the name background are used to generate CSS with background and width information
* Lines with border-[top|bottom|left|right] are used for CSS border attribut
* Every paragraph amd character style will be converted to CSS

ToDo
* Export caracter format
* slice img layers automatical
* generate true css margin and padding
* generate buttons
* generate inputs
* Shadow/inner Shadow
* Hover/active
* Problems with illustrator effects
* export TextFrames with Inline Styles
* Better calculating the width
* CSS Attribut width without background
